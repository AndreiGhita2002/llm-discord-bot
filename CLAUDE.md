# Discord LLM Bot

A Discord bot powered by a local Ollama LLM with optional web search capabilities.

**Default persona: Kronk** - The default configuration ships with "Kronk" (from Emperor's New Groove) as the bot personality, but this is fully customizable via `config.yaml`.

## AI Instructions

When working on this project, keep the "Known Issues / TODOs" section below up to date:
- Mark items as complete `[x]` or remove them when fixed
- Add new TODOs when you discover issues or leave something incomplete
- Add notes about non-obvious implementation details

When updating the changelog in README.md:
- Group all changes from the same day under one version
- Check the date of the last commit (`git log -1 --format=%cd --date=short`) - if it's today, add to that version
- Only increment the patch version (smallest digit) if last commit was a different day
- Only increment minor/major version if the user explicitly says it's a major change
- Today's date is available in the environment info at the start of the conversation

## Project Structure

- `main.py` - Main bot code
- `kronk_config.yaml` - Default config (Kronk persona), always loaded as base
- `config.yaml` - User overrides (gitignored, optional). Only needs fields you want to change.
- `memory.py` - Lightweight memory system (user summaries + conversation recall)
- `pyproject.toml` - Dependencies (uses uv)
- `setup-daemon-mac.sh` - macOS daemon setup script
- `setup-memory.sh` - Initializes memory directory and pulls embedding model
- `bot_memory/` - Created by setup script, stores user summaries and conversation embeddings (gitignored)

## Key Configuration

Configuration uses `kronk_config.yaml` as defaults, with `config.yaml` providing overrides. The configs are deep-merged, so `config.yaml` only needs fields you want to change (nested fields like `memory.do_memory` work too).
- **Model**: Configurable in `config.yaml` (default: `gemma3:27b`)
- **System prompt**: Customizable personality/behavior in `config.yaml`. Supports placeholders:
  - `{{discord_display_name}}`: Bot's display name (replaced at runtime)
  - `{{discord_user_id}}`: Bot's user ID (replaced at runtime)
  - `{{github_url}}`: GitHub URL from config (replaced at load time)
- **Message history**: Short-term memory settings in `config.yaml`:
  - `limit`: Number of recent messages to fetch (default: 10)
  - `max_age_minutes`: Ignore messages older than this (default: 60, set to 0 to disable)
- **Memory settings**: Long-term memory with granular toggles:
  - `do_memory`: Master toggle for all memory features
  - `user_memory`: Toggle user-specific summaries
  - `conversation_memory`: Toggle conversation recall
  - `user_summary_update_chance`: Probability of updating user summary (0.0-1.0)
  - `max_stored_conversations`: Maximum conversations to store
- **Tools**: TODO - placeholder in `config.yaml` for future implementation

Environment variables:
- **Discord token**: `DISCORD_BOT_TOKEN` env var (falls back to `KRONK_TOKEN` for backward compatibility)
- **Ollama API key**: `OLLAMA_API_KEY` env var (only needed for web search)
- **Web search**: Only enabled if `OLLAMA_API_KEY` is found

## How It Works

1. Bot responds when @mentioned or when someone replies to its message
2. When triggered, fetches recent messages from that channel (configurable limit and max age)
3. Referenced messages are inserted *before* the user's current message in context (so model responds to user, not the reference)
4. Uses `ollama.AsyncClient()` for async LLM calls

## Web Search Feature

Web search uses Ollama's cloud API (not local), so it requires:
- An API key from https://ollama.com/settings/keys
- `OLLAMA_API_KEY` environment variable set
- A model that supports tool calling (llama3.1+, qwen3, etc.)

Automatically enabled when `OLLAMA_API_KEY` is set.

## Memory System

The bot has a lightweight memory system (`memory.py`) that provides:

1. **User Summaries** (`user_memory`): LLM-generated summaries of each user (personality, interests, facts). Updated probabilistically (configurable chance) to avoid overhead.

2. **Conversation Recall** (`conversation_memory`): Stores conversation snippets with embeddings for semantic search. When a user sends a message, relevant past conversations are retrieved and injected into context.

Both features can be independently toggled via config. The `do_memory` flag is a master switch that disables all memory features when false.

**Requirements**:
- Needs `nomic-embed-text` model in Ollama: `ollama pull nomic-embed-text`
- Data stored in `./bot_memory/` directory (configurable via `memory_dir` in config.yaml)
- Backward compatible: falls back to `./kronk_memory/` if it exists
- Keeps last N conversations (configurable via `max_stored_conversations`, default 500) to prevent unbounded growth

## Known Issues / TODOs

[ ] Websearch not working.
[ ] Log channel feature: the user can set a channel for bot logs, and the bot will announce when it's turning on or off.
[ ] Implement configurable tools system in config.yaml.

## Running

```bash
# Install dependencies
uv sync

# (Optional) Create config overrides - only add fields you want to change
# If not created, defaults from kronk_config.yaml are used
echo 'model: "llama3.1:8b"' > config.yaml  # example: just override the model

# Setup memory system (creates directory + pulls embedding model)
./setup-memory.sh

# Set environment variables
export DISCORD_BOT_TOKEN="your-discord-token"
export OLLAMA_API_KEY="your-ollama-key"  # optional, for web search

# Run
uv run python main.py
```
